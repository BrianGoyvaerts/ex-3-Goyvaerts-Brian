In this exercise i try to make a REST-based calculator as an assignment for the course data distribution. 

Because i had no clue how to begin, i started with an exercise we made in class: 
    /** Created by Brian on 12/10/2016. **/
    var express = require ("express");
    var app = express();
    var bustenparser = require('body-parser');
    app.use(bustenparser.json());
    var books = [];
    books.push({id:1, name:"Beginning Node JS", rating: 4});
    app.get("/books", function(request, response){
        response.send(books);
    }); 
    console.log("test");
    app.listen(4567);
    
Few hours and a lot of help from classmembers and the internet later, i came up with my first commit. 
Using 'Postman' the API was able to do some calculating (using a key) 

Next step was to make it easier to compute a challenge. After doing some research i learned from www.stackoverflow.com that it 
is possible to type your challenge in the url. 
I very soon realised this wasn't that easy. So i headed over to www.jetbrains.com, a site recommended in class.
